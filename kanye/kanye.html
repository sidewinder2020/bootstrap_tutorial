        <p>Not so fast, there, Bob. You forgot to affix the warning label to your forehead. You know, the one that reads "Exposure to Bob Kelso can be hazardous to your health, thus affording the reader a fighting chance to escape the waste and contamination that is…Bob Kelso.”</p>

        <p>Oh, and Nervous Guy- if I were you, I’d go ahead and swallow that entire mouthful of baby carrots. Because, if I hear you make even one more damn crunch, I’m gonna use the remainder of the carrots in that bag to make you completely air-tight, son.</p>

        <p>Oh, my goodness. He actually tricked you. This is so very delicious and filling I don’t think I’m going to be able to eat the rest of the evening. In fact, I honestly don’t think I can have one more bite of your painful humiliation. I find I’m just a little stuffed. Will take my keys to go, though.</p>
